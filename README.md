# AssignmentProject---web-server

This is a small project made to create a web server.
The "Web site" running on the local server lets you create a user account and login to your home page.
The home page itself doesn't have any features except for some basic routing.
The user password is encrypted using "bcrypt" and the database used is MongoDB.

The dependencies can be installed using "npm install" while in the root directory.
